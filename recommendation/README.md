it comes with number of flavours 

* item-item filtering
	Item-item filtering will take a particular item, find people who liked that item, and find other items that those people (or people similar to them) also liked.
 
* user-item filtering
	On the other hand, user-item filtering will take a particular person, find people who are similar to that person based on similar ratings, and recommend items those similar people liked.
